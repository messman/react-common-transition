## react-transition-group

This project is a fork of [React's react-transition-group](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group) from December 2021. This project retains the BSD 3-Clause License from that project.

This fork was created for the following reasons:
- Experiment with using React hooks instead of class components
- Make changes to the API to better support working with `styled-components`
- Retain the BSD 3-Clause License for modifications of the transition implementation

This fork, while public, is generally not open for issues or feature requests.

Relevant documentation from that project:

> A set of components for managing component states (including mounting and unmounting) over time, specifically designed with animation in mind.
